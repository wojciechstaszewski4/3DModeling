# üé® 3D Modeling and Animation Portfolio  

This repository contains a collection of **3D modeling and animation projects** created using **3ds Max**. These projects showcase a variety of skills, including:  
- 3D modeling: Designing objects and scenes with realistic geometry.  
- Texturing and lighting: Applying textures and setting up lighting for enhanced realism.  
- Rendering: Producing high-quality renders of models and scenes.  
- Animation: Creating dynamic and fluid animations, from simple movements to complex sequences.

## üìÇ Folder Structure  

Each folder includes:  
1. **Animations/Renders**: Final rendered images or animations of the project.  
2. **3ds Max Project File**: Source file for the 3D model or animation.  
3. **References**: Reference images used during the creation process.  
4. **Textures** (if applicable): Textures applied to the model or animation.
